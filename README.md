# Tools-Whole Genome Phylogeny
A list of awesome tools and pipelines that reconstructs phylogeny from NGS data (complete and draft genomes, reads).

SNP
-------------------------------------
* [SNPhylo](https://github.com/thlee/SNPhylo): Generates phylogeny from SNP data.
* [kSNP](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ksnp/): Identifies pan-genome SNPs from genomes and estimates their phylogeny.
* [parsnp](https://github.com/marbl/parsnp): Core genome alignment, SNP detection, and phylogeny.

*Disclaimer*: Some of these tools might have already been used in categories where its not listed. It is likely not listed due to lack of updating this list or it did not show up in the first page of google result or was not exclusively mentioned in the abstract or readme files.
