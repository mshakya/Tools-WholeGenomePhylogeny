# Tools-Whole Genome Phylogeny
A list of awesome tools and pipelines that reconstructs phylogeny from NGS data (complete and draft genomes, reads).

SNP
-------------------------------------
* [SNPhylo](https://github.com/thlee/SNPhylo): Generates phylogeny from SNP data.
* [kSNP](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ksnp/): Identifies pan-genome SNPs from genomes and estimates their phylogeny.
* [parsnp](https://github.com/marbl/parsnp): Core genome alignment, SNP detection, and phylogeny.
* [REALPHY](http://realphy.unibas.ch/fcgi/realphy): Automates phylogenetic reconstruction from raw sequencing reads.
